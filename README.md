# MessengerProject

Messenger activity built to mimic Samsung Messenger
Goal to have the same functionality as Samsung messenger minus calling and other non-messenging functions
Project timeline 6/22/15-7/3/15

The code is well commented and an apk can be provided on request.

Assumptions:
Assumptions for this project were that it would be able to completed with on average three hours put in after an average work day for 12 days.
Totaling to 36hrs. As I started this project, through initial research I quickly realized this was a generous timeframe.
I was able to build the base UI and the functionality of texts halfway through the project.

Challenges Faced:
Despite the timeline I built, I was unawere of my own time. Having to step in as lead at work cut many of my project hours.
I was only able to work on this project half the days and only one weekend day on the project as a result.
Because of this truncated timeline, attachments and the bubble style of messenging were left to be implimented later. 
Despite the challenges faced, the app itself is functional according to instructions and astheticly similar to Samsung Messenger.
I also added a friends name as the title thread in the action bar.

Total Hours spent: 18hrs
